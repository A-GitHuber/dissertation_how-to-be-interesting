As you know, Beijing is the capital of China, so it’s an excellent choice for a holiday. There are a lot of places where they may want to visit, let me introduce some of them. If they want to experience the culture of China, they should go to somewhere like The Palace Museum and Nanluoguxiang where they can see the Chinese historical royal buildings and  eat the classic Chinese food. Also they can visit the Great Wall which is the symbol of Chinese history. And in the Great Wall, they can see the beatiful scenery of Beijing. By the way, because Beijing is one of the biggest cities in China, during the holiday, I think they can travel by subway. In Beijing Subway is so convinient that they can travel to almost all places they want. At last, hope they would have a great time in Beijing, if they have any problem, they can connect with me.
