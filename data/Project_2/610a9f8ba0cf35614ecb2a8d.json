Once you start to understand how English pronunciation works, you can understand so much more when you hear it!\n    Sure, you can always create a new one just for yourself, right?\n===========================Separation Line=============================\nSTUDENT:\n    yes","coversation_id":"257","label":["EXP INT 1","INT 0"],"Comments":[]},{"id":36278,"text":"TEACHER:\n    We haven't been able to do much pronunciation work here, obviously :)\n    But! There's a really nice series on the BBC Learning English website\n    It's called Tim's Pronunciation Workshop\n    It's really useful (and funny too!) and teaches you how to understand when people speak fast and don't pronounce every word very carefully\n===========================Separation Line=============================\nSTUDENT:\n    I will also check it later\n    I found the site","coversation_id":"257","label":["EXP INT 2","INT 1"],"Comments":[]},{"id":36279,"text":"TEACHER:\n    You can just find it through your search engine because links don't work as we know\n    Perfect! There's lots of fun stuff to do there, too!\n    And of course, if you'd like a project, I always recommend reading in English (and learning those new words), and our favourites, the HP books are perfect for this\n    The first two books are written for younger readers as you know, and the language is not as difficult. By the time you get to the third book, you've already got some experience reading in English and it's easier for you anyway!\n    The way I used to approach reading in English was to learn every single new word at first! It's hard work at first and you can only read a few pages at a time, but then, after a few chapters it becomes so much easier! There are usually very few new words by the end of the book\n===========================Separation Line=============================\nSTUDENT:\n    I think I will try\n    maybe not the whole book\n    something not long","coversation_id":"257","label":["EXP INT 2","INT 1"],"Comments":[]},{"id":36280,"text":"TEACHER:\n    Yes, you can take it slowly at first and then see how it goes!\n===========================Separation Line=============================\nSTUDENT:\n    I think somebody gave me an English book\n    as a gift","coversation_id":"257","label":["EXP INT 2","INT 2"],"Comments":[]},{"id":36281,"text":"TEACHER:\n    Obviously, if there's a blog \/ Insta \/ tik tok account that you like in English, that could be perfect for smaller texts\n===========================Separation Line=============================\nSTUDENT:\n    probably I like watching tiktok videos on English\n    for example I watch an anime","coversation_id":"257","label":["EXP INT 3","INT 2"],"Comments":[]},{"id":36282,"text":"TEACHER:\n    Oh yes, I think you mentioned it before!\n===========================Separation Line=============================\nSTUDENT:\n    and there is a Russian side of it\n    and there is English side","coversation_id":"257","label":["EXP INT 2","INT 1"],"Comments":[]},{"id":36283,"text":"TEACHER:\n    Oh, like a comic?\n===========================Separation Line=============================\nSTUDENT:\n    no, just some videos in tiktok","coversation_id":"257","label":["EXP INT 2","INT 1"],"Comments":[]},{"id":36284,"text":"TEACHER:\n    Ah sure!\n===========================Separation Line=============================\nSTUDENT:\n    you see, if you watch anything (anime, serial , film or else ) you can see some different fandom videos on tiktok","coversation_id":"257","label":["EXP INT 2","INT 2"],"Comments":[]},{"id":36285,"text":"TEACHER:\n    Ok, <STUDENT>, I've got to let you go now!
